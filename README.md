# Lecture-Scheduler
An application that reorients lecture timings to a student's timezone to provide the atmosphere of an actual lecture (no pauses/fast-forwards as it is along with other students), in order to improve their productivity and punctuality. 

## Getting Started
Run the app on your phone, and choose a class in order to get access to that lecture. As this is a lecture everyone will be watching, it would add you at the time this lecture is currently at.
